<h4>What is MetRec?</h4>
<p align="justify">MetRec is a database of <b>Met</b>abolic <b>Rec</b>onstructions.The purpose of the MetRec server is to host a repository of carefully curated high-quality GSMs(genome-scale metabolic models) of pathogenic organisms.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<h4>How is it different from other such metabolic model databases?</h4>
<p align="justify">The lack of usage of standard nomenclature for the metabolites and reactions makes it difficult to compare and match similar metabolic pathways across different models and different databases. To address this gap, we created a new platform which houses metabolic models of pathogenic organisms in a systematized fashion.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<!-- <h4>How is the phylogenetic profile score computed?</h4>
<p align="justify">A score to each of the matches (that satisfied the BLAST criteria with at least 50% sequence similarity across 50% of the length of the query sequence) is calculated as follows:
<img style="display:block; align:middle;" src="images/score.png" />
where E is the e-value corresponding to the hit. We discard matches with an e-value higher than e-4 and assign them a score of zero. This scoring scheme is similar in principle to the one used in the erstwhile PLEX database (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701682">Date & Marcotte, 2005</a>).</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<h4>How do I use generated phylogenetic profiles?</h4>
<p align="justify">For the group of 417 organisms that we consider, the phylogenetic profile of a protein can be viewed as a vector of length 417, with each entry in the vector denoting the presence or absence of the protein in question across each of the 417 organisms.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<h4>How is the STRING score computed?</h4>
<p align="justify">The combined score are computed by combining the probabilities from the different evidence channels, correcting for the probability of randomly observing an interaction. For a more detailed description please see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15608232">von Mering,<i>et al</i> ,Nucleic Acids Res. 2005</a>.For more details,please see <a target="_blank" href="http://string-db.org//">STRING</a>.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<h4>What IDs can be used to query for proteins? </h4>
<p align="justify">For simplicity, we support only UniProt IDs. UniProt IDs are unique and can be easily obtained from the UniProt database for any protein. The STRING database also has an excellent ‘dictionary’ of aliases for protein names. </p>
</ul>
<ul>
<h4>I am getting many instances of ‘nomatch’ in my results. What do they mean? </h4>
<p align="justify">'No matching protein' or 'nomatch' means that there is no hit for the given protein in that corresponding organism.If you are looking for only matching proteins or interactions,you can use get Groupwise phyloprofile or jointphyloprofile which gives you only hits and also get the results based on major divisions. </p>
