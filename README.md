## Collaboration

### Naming Conventions

- Use `lowerCamelCase`for variables, properties, files and folder names.
- Use `UpperCamelCase` for class names. 
- Use prefix like `is`, `are`, or `has` for bool variables.
- Use self explanatory names for variables, E.g `let cartPage`.
- Always start functions with a verb and the entity being affect by it, E.g `async goToTshirtGallery()`. 

### Eslint
It's necessary to run Eslint before create a Pull Request. For this, you can use the commands:

**All files**

```
npx eslint .
```

**One file**

```
npx eslint file1.js
```

**Two file**

```
npx eslint file1.js file2.js
```

**Multiple files**

```
npx eslint lib/**
```
To fix the errors found by Eslint, you can run:

```
npx eslint --fix
```
